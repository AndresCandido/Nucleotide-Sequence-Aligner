# Nucleotide-Sequence-Aligner

Nucleotide-Sequence-Aligner is a MATLAB-based tool designed for simulating DNA sequencing reads and aligning them back to the original nucleotide sequence. This project provides an educational and practical framework for understanding and testing fundamental sequence alignment algorithms, which are essential in bioinformatics for tasks such as genome assembly, variant detection, and gene annotation.

## Features

- Simulates sequencing reads from a given nucleotide sequence or a string of text
- Aligns simulated reads back to the reference sequence
- Visualizes alignment results and statistics
- Modular and easy to extend for custom alignment strategies or scoring schemes

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2021a and newer)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndresCandido/Nucleotide-Sequence-Aligner.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and add the project directory to your path.
3. Run the main script or functions as described in the code documentation.

## Use Cases

- Educational tool for learning about sequence alignment algorithms
- Testing and benchmarking simple alignment strategies
- Prototype development for bioinformatics workflows
